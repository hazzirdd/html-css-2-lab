        <p>Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
            Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door
            And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
            They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (agh!)
            It's the return of the "ah, wait, no way, you're kidding
            He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?"
            And Dr. Dre said, nothing, you idiots!
            Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha ha!)
            Feminist women love Eminem
            "Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
            Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
            Flippin' the you-know-who"
            "Yeah, but he's so cute though"</p>
            <p>Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
            But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
            Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
            But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
            "My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips"
            And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
            And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
            And expect them not to know what a woman is
            Of course they're gonna know what it is
            By the time they hit fourth grade
            They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
            We ain't nothin' but mammals, well, some of us, cannibals
            Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
            But if we can dead animals and antelopes
            Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
            But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
            Women, wave your hands, sing the chorus, and it goes</p>
